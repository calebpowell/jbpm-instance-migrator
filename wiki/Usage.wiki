The following page explains how to use the jbpm-instance-migrator library. 

* Defining a Migration

Migrations are written as Java classes. The class must implement the org.jbpm.instance.migration.Migration interface, it must not be abstract, and it must contain a default constructor. The Migration interface declares one method that must be implemented called 'createNodeMap()', whose return value is an instance of a StateNodeMap. A StateNodeMap is used by a migrator to determine which nodes have been deprecated and which nodes have superseded the deprecated nodes. In the following __ApplicationProcessMigration001__ migration, the __init__ node has been deprecate and superseded by the __start__ node:

{{{
public class ApplicationProcessMigration001 implements Migration{
   
   public StateNodeMap createNodeMap() {
       return new StateNodeMap(new String[][]{
               {"init", "start"}       
       });
   }
}

}}}
